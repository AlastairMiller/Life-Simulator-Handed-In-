# SE2JA11 Project Life Simulator

This is my submission for the first coursework for the second year Java module. In retrospect the code quality is poor so a refactor is in progress in **Life Simulator Extended** available on github. It is worth noting that I had only begun learning Java for two months before starting this assignment. A summary of the requirements are:


> In this coursework you are required to implement an application, the “Artificial Life Simulator”, to manage, run and visualise simulations of artificial life forms on 2D maps. The horizontal and vertical dimensions of the 2D map should be user-defined parameters. A life form should be able to move, sense the environment (sight, smell, etc.), find and eat food to increase its energy/stamina level. 

The report as well as the source code are included within this repository.

## I achieved 64% in this assignment.
